# 🎬 MovieAnalysis_NLP

This is a simple Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that analyzes **Turkish movie reviews** and predicts whether they are **positive or negative**. I used a **BERT-based model** and trained it on a small dataset.

## 🧩 What this project does

- Loads and cleans movie reviews
- Uses a pre-trained Turkish BERT model
- Trains the model on labeled reviews (positive / negative)
- Shows accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix
- Saves the trained model for later use

## 📌 Why I made this

I wanted to learn more about NLP and deep learning. Since my computer can’t handle very large data, I used a smaller dataset and still got good results using transfer learning.

## 🔍 Tools and Libraries

- Python
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on setup)
- Hugging Face Transformers
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- pandas

Install needed libraries with:
